# TeraTinder (TCC module)

Optional module for TCC. It lets you swipe left/right on players around you. No actual matching or processing is performed when swiping.

#### Installation

#### Usage

Use `Ctrl + Alt + T` to show TERA Tinder main window while ingame.

Matches are populated as players spawn around you. Teleport or relog clears the list.
